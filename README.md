# b r 1

_b r 1_ (Bitsy Reality 1) is a [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy)-based remake of my earlier [Unity](http://unity3d.com)-based game [_v r 1_](http://www.pippinbarr.com/2016/05/19/v-r-1/) which was itself an attempt to "remake" Gregor Schneider's _u r 1_ from his [The Haus u r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Schneider#The_%22Haus_u_r%22) project.
