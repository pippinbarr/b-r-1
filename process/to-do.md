## General

- ~~__ACTUALLY LOOKS KIND OF GOOD__ Experiment with a floor tile (in order to throw certain things into relief like the hole in the floor)~~
- ~~Add window sprite/item to all rooms~~
- ~~Fix broken sprite placement~~
- ~~__SADLY NO__ Experiment with dialogs+exits (can they coexist? It would help for ending on the window each time...)~~
- ~~__I THINK IT LOOKS ALRIGHT?__ Experiment with a terrain tile to allow for texture outside the room?~~
- ~~__NAH.__ Determine room order by playthrough~~
- ~~__YEAH.__ Determine room order by intuition and staging~~
  - ~~Start = 1 / Door to door = 5 / No light = 11 / Pieces = 13 / Palette = 9 / Intersection = 2 / Locked out = 10 / Inventory = 14 / Window to window = 16 / Hole in floor = 8 / Upside down = 15 / Animation = 7 / Door down = 3 / Floating objects = 6 / Door in floor = 4 / Organised = 12 / End = 17~~
- ~~Exits for all rooms~~
- ~~__WENT WITH NUMBERS__ Number font for interstitials? (Or will this be with dialog?)~~
- ~~__WENT WITH IN-ROOM NUMBERING, SINCE THE ORIGINAL HAS NO INTERSTITIALS__ Interstitials~~
- ~~Dialog for all rooms/objects~~
  - ~~Default text for window: "Through the window you can see a small room containing a bed, a metal trunk, and a metal tube. The light is on and the door is open."~~
  - ~~Default text for radiator: "A radiator."~~
  - ~~Default text for trunk: "A metal trunk."~~
  - ~~Default text for tube: "A metal tube."~~
  - ~~Default text for bed: "A bed with a pillow and a folded blanket."~~
- ~~Fix organised (believe it has 12 floor tiles instead of 10)~~
- ~~__WENT WITH YES__ Should door-down and door in floor be thinner?__~~
- ~~Add number to final scene, since it's meant to have one~~
- ~~Page background to black?~~
- ~~Fixed size in browser? (480x480? 640x640? Or the scaling is okay?)~~
- ~~__KNOWN ISSUE. IF I WERE A GOOD PERSON I COULD TRY TO FIX AND DO A PULL REQUEST__ Investigate bug around input (seems to get stuck)~~

## ~~The rooms~~

### ~~Start~~
- ~~Create basic room~~

### ~~Door to door~~
- ~~Create basic and duplicate rooms~~

### ~~Hole in floor~~
- ~~Create basic frame~~
- ~~Consider weird problem that the floor doesn't have a 'hole' colour...~~
- ~~Add floor tiles to other levels to allow this level to have 'nothing'~~
- ~~__DID IT__ Consider that we would now need a tile for the outside as well to contrast with nothing... fucking hell~~
- ~~__FALLING IS PRETTY COOL NOW__ Add exit that would take us to what? Blackness for falling? Just the next level?~~

### ~~Locked out~~
-  ~~Create basic frame with wall instead of door for closed door~~

### ~~Organised~~
- ~~Create basic room pieces in a grid~~
- ~~Add the sprites~~

### ~~Window to window~~
- ~~Create basic frame~~
- (Fret about the ways this one is throwing my '3D' representation into doubt, notably the height of the bottom-most wall.)

### ~~No light~~
- ~~Duplicate start room~~
- ~~Change palette to make tiles and sprites very close to base colour~~
- ~~-__C'EST LA VIE__ (Worry about how this means the avatar will be less visible too)~~
- ~~Add dialog that emphasises lack of visibility~~

### ~~Door in floor~~
- ~~Create start area with just a hole in the ground~~
- ~~Create sideways room~~
- ~~Rework the sprites because they should be jumped, no stuck to the wall~~
- ~~__IT'S ACTUALLY FINE?__ (Worry about how incomprehensible this might be, but could be saved by dialogs?)~~

### ~~Pieces~~
- ~~Put every tile/sprite into the same space as the start room, but randomised (by eye)~~
- ~~(Feel proud this looks kind of great)~~

### ~~Floating objects~~
- ~~Duplicate the room~~
- ~~Make the sprites be one or two pixels further up~~
- ~~Dialog will probably be great/helpful here~~

### ~~Door down~~
- ~~Duplicate door in floor, but flipped~~
- ~~Furniture jumbled in similar way~~

### ~~Upside down~~
- ~~Duplicate start room~~
- ~~Turn bed over~~
- ~~Reverse radiator and window~~

### ~~Intersection~~
- ~~Place original room~~
- ~~Draw 90ยบ rotation room over/in it (hard, so hard)~~
- ~~Write dialog for the window sprite that at least lets me describe a little of what's in there~~
- ~~__NO__ Should the intersection be somewhat processual instead? You have the original and then you add the second over the top (replacing tiles as needed? Or is that foolish because it will miss out on some of the more obviously intersecting ideas? Perhaps so...)~~

### ~~Palette swap~~
- ~~Duplicate original~~
- ~~Create a zany palette (currently CMY which are like the 'opposite' of K-based greys)~~

### ~~Maybe an inventory one where you collect all the elements~~
- ~~Duplicate original~~
- ~~Replace all objects with items and dialog for pickup~~
- ~~__NOT REALLY__ Where would this one actually end? How would you know you can pick anything up? Can you end on picking them all up?~~

### ~~Animated tiles~~
- ~~Duplicate start~~
- ~~Animate tiles on and off~~
- ~~Animate sprites on and off (opposite to tiles)~~
- ~~(Hadn't realised animations are only two frames)~~

### ~~End (Locked in)~~
- ~~Duplicate~~
- ~~Remove door etc.~~
- ~~__NAH__ (Wonder whether this should be the item collection one?)~~
