# b r 1

This is the process documentation wiki for the game _b r 1_. The process documentation available here is the result of following the [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma) (Method for Design Materialisation and Analysis), an approach to game design recoverability that forms the basis of the [Games as Research](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project I am part of with [Rilla Khaled](http://www.rillakhaled.com/) and [Jonathan Lessard](https://jonathanlessard.net/).

### [Design Journal](./journal.md)
