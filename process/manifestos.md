# Manifesto #1 -- Sunday, 6 May 2017, 13:04

- v r 4 seeks to remake v r 1, v r 2, v r 3 in Bitsy
- I'm interested in what comes to the surface when you use a completely different engine to construct "the same game" (Bitsy versus Unity, 2D versus 3D, low resolution versus high resolution, minimal interactivity versus scripting, silence versus sfx/ambience, tiny ontology versus large ontology, ...)
- Each game is a remake in _principle_ of the original game, not an attempt to re-represent the game in a way that evokes the original game, but rather an attempt to convey the same ideas of the original in this new form
- This is a boring manifesto and I'm sorry

# Manifesto #2 -- Saturday, 19 May 2018, 20:10

- b r 1 is v r 1 is u r 1
- Bitsy is Unity is construction
- Pippin Barr is Pippin Barr is Gregor Schneider
- Bitsy and Unity are the same thing, a means to make a world to walk around in
- Bitsy and Unity are totally different
- 2D versus 3D
- Soundless versus soundful
- Limited versus "limitless"
- Small versus Big
- David versus Goliath
- What happens when you do the same thing with different tools?
- Can you ever do the same thing twice?
- Who are you, anyway? What is this?

# Manifesto #3 -- Sunday, 20 May 2018, 14:51

u r 1 is a room by Gregor Schneider, made multiple times, striving for authenticity and identical reproduction. v r 1 is a game made in Unity that seeks to recreate the spirit of u r 1 in the context of a game engine. Reproduction is just cut-and-paste, so v r 1 focuses on manipulations and variations of the space that are Unity's equivalent of carpentry. b r 1 is a game made in Bitsy that seeks to recreate the spirit of v r 1 in another game engine. Bitsy is similar to Unity in that it provides a way to make worlds you walk in, but it's different in being 2D and vastly more constrained in its possibilities, from palettes to pixels to interactions. b r 1 is thus a reflection on how this process of double translation can take place, thinking about both u r 1 and v r 1 and producing something similar but new, that shows the marks of the original artwork and the original videogame, but also has the creases and lines of Bitsy as well. b r 1 shows you what Bitsy is like, and what Unity is like, and what Gregor Schneider's u r 1 is like.

# Research Statement #1 -- Tuesday, 22 May 2018, 13:00

[_u r 1_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Schneider#The_"Haus_u_r") is a room made by Gregor Schneider that contains (with some variations) a window, a radiator, a bed, a trunk, and a metal tube. _u r 1_ is an artwork that Schneider has created and recreated multiple times in multiple locations, emblematic of his practice of duplicating spaces with fanatical precision.

[_v r 1_](http://www.pippinbarr.com/2016/05/19/v-r-1/) is a videogame made by Pippin Barr that recreates Schneider's _u r 1_ in the [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) game engine. In an effort to evoke Schneider's passionate carpentry and attention to detail, _v r 1_ presents the room in a series of different configurations, duplications, and deconstructions. In digital spaces, duplication is trivial, and so variation is used to replace it.

[_b r 1_](http://pippinbarr.github.io/b-r-1) is a videogame made by Pippin Barr that recreates _v r 1_ in the [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) game engine. _v r 1_ is in 3D, in first-person, has sound effects, simulates physics, but Bitsy games are in 2D, in third-person, are silent, are static. _b r 1_ is a game made to explore what happens when you translate a game from one engine to another, from Unity to Bitsy, while fighting to keep the underlying ideas of the original game in tact.

_How do you draw _u r 1_ with 8x8 pixel tiles?_  
_What does it mean to see everything at once?_  
_What does Bitsy want?_  
_What would Gregor Schneider do?_
